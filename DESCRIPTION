    Choropleth Maps for USA States

Description: Cartogram heatmaps are an alternative to choropleth maps for USA States
    and are based on work by the Washington Post graphics department in their report
    on "The states most threatened by trade". "State bins" preserve as much of the
    geographic placement of the states as possible but has the look and feel of a
    traditional heatmap. Functions are provided that allow for use of a binned,
    discrete scale, a continuous scale or manually specified colors depending on
    what is needed for the underlying data.
